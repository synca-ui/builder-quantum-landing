## Key Principles for Minimalistic Design

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential options first, advanced behind "More" buttons
2. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill based on business type and common patterns
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use typography and spacing to guide attention
4. **Single Focus**: Each step should have one primary goal
5. **Contextual Help**: Inline hints instead of separate explanations
6. **Immediate Feedback**: Live preview updates and validation
7. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Fewer decisions per step

## Visual Consistency Guidelines

- **Colors**: Teal primary, purple secondary, gray neutrals
- **Spacing**: 16px base unit (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48px)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with 3-4 font sizes max
- **Components**: Consistent button sizes, card styles, form elements
- **Layout**: 2-column max, generous whitespace
- **Mobile**: Stack vertically, maintain touch targets

This plan will create a more focused, less overwhelming experience while maintaining all necessary functionality.
